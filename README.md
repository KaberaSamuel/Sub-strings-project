# Sub-strings-project
This is a project in Odin Ruby section, it won't have an UI yet, it will just run in terminal
The Purpose of this project is to implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
